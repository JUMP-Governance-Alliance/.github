### **Mission**
The **JUMP Governance Alliance** is the decentralized body dedicated to maintaining and enforcing the **JUMP Protocol**—a universal standardization layer for data clarity and convergence. 

We develop the infrastructure required to strip away noise and standardize disparate information streams into a single, immutable, and cross-referenceable format.

### **The Three Pillars**
* **Universal Standardization:** Enforcing interoperability across distinct systems.
* **Data Gravity:** Creating a convergence point where information flows toward a verifiable center.
* **Auditability:** Establishing a "bend in the universe" where consensus meets absolute clarity.
